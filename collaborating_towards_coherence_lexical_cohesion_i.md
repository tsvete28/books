# Collaborating towards coherence: lexical cohesion in English discourse {#collaborating-towards-coherence-lexical-cohesion-in-english-discourse}

от Sanna-Kaisa Tanskanen

p. 4- definition of text (for the evaluate the usefulness of cohesion/coherence part); cannot decontextualize text - the co-text and the context are important (in Beaken p. 63) and de Beaugrande and Dressler (quoted in Beaken p.55) talk about other important factors that produce meaning in a text. Important are intentionality (cohesion of intended goal in the text?) and structural cohesion (Louwerse 2005) p. 20 - background knowledge; situationality of the text ???
