# Under the Lens: Cohesion and Coherence {#under-the-lens-cohesion-and-coherence}

**Under the Lens: Cohesion and Coherence within a Customer Reference Story Document**

What makes a chunk of information “a text” and how we comprehend the meaning of a text is a question that has some resonance in the popular mind if we judge by the various posts on social networks inviting you to read a text with scrambled spelling just to show that you can still understand it. In the routine flow of work emails in my Inbox, I often stumble on one-liners or one-paragraph emails that could be ungrammatical, use words or phrases that do not make sense, or consist of half sentences, but I can still figure out miraculously what the sender wants from me and respond in a meaningful way. To get to the meaning of a text, we somehow go beyond the individual significance of correct spelling, proper use of grammar or lexical units. de Beaugrande gives a plausible explanation of the process of text comprehension by stressing the very nature of text as a “communicative event where linguistic, cognitive, and social actions converge, and not just as the sequence of words that were uttered.” (de Beaugrande as quoted in Transkanen 2006). In this view meaning emerges not from the text itself as a product or artifact, but from the interaction between the reader and the text.

In the following analysis, two aspects of text as communicative event will come under the lens:

*   Cohesion, defined here as the linguistic elements that internally connect a chunk of information into a consistent text.

*   Coherence, defined here as the components in the text that connect it to the external world (Beaken 2007) by corresponding to the mental representation in the mind of the reader (Louwerse 2005).

I want to investigate how cohesion and coherence are sustained within a promotional business document by applying the model suggested by Louwerse (2005). Dilworth (2012) argues that: “...it is in the unfamiliar setting and confrontation with an unfamiliar problem that the learning can prove to be greatest.“ Although I am familiar with the technology that the document promotes, promotional writing is still uncharted territory for me. Hopefully, this unfamiliarity will lead to fresh insights when tracing the linguistic threads that interconnect the text of the document, and the mental threads that the language of the document inspires with the world outside the text.

The document is a customer reference story, entitled: “Optical Company Sharpens Focus On Customer Service With an SOA” (see the Appendix for the full text of the document). Customer reference stories are written by the Professional Services department in the company to present a success sales story of a customer who has integrating our products into their business and has gained revenue or other benefits in the process. The document is available from the company&#039;s publicwebsite and it is aimed at business analysts or decision makers who work for other potential or existing customers. The goal of a customer reference story is to put a more personal face to technology by giving a specific example of how the complex enterprise systems that the company develops work in a real production setting.

Textual elements of Cohesion in the Customer Reference Story document

Louwerse (2005) identifies five categories of grammatical and vocabulary elements that create semantic cohesion in a text: referential, causal, temporal, additive and spacial. Each category expresses a relation within or between the sentences in the text that brings them together as a semantic body of meaning.

**Referential cohesion** refers the reader backwards or forwards to people, objects, or events in the text. Connections within the text, based on reference, can be achieved using grammar-based devices, for example:

That’s why Apollo-Optik, as Germany’s largest retail chain, operates by the motto “far more than glasses.”

In other words, _it_ aims to provide the highest level of quality in customized eyeglasses on time, every time.

The pronoun “it” serves as anaphora or backward-pointing to the customer (“Apollo-Optik”) in the previous sentence. Other grammar-based backward reference in the documents is the use of the demonstrative pronoun “that” to refer to the whole of the previous sentence in the following example:

More than 10 million pairs of glasses are sold each year in Germany. _That_ translates into annual

industry revenue of some three billion Euros, including associated services.

The use of vocabulary devices for reference cohesion in the text is mostly driven by repetition, for example:

The first is a _data warehouse_ developed with Software AG’s Adabas and Natural. The _data_

_warehouse_ contains customer, order and inventory information from all stores.

The name of the customer (“Apollo-Optik”) is repeated about 20 times in a four-page document, nearly in every other paragraph. It is followed closely by “SOA”, the name of the technology bought by the customer, which shows up about 13 times (as either “SOA” or “the SOA platform”). We can notice some limited use of synonyms to refer to something mentioned previously:

In the future, Apollo-Optik may look to use BAM to measure Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)—for example, on which stores receive the most warning messages. With this data in hand, the _company_ would know which stores need more training.

“Company” in the second sentence is one of the rare instances where the name of the customer was replaced by a synonym.

Substitution of a part of the text with a phrase is another way to make this text cohesive as we can see in the following example:

Loyal to its promise of providing “far more than glasses,” Apollo-Optik strives _to serve customers with high-quality products and on-time delivery_. To meet _this goal_ in a highly competitive market, Apollo-Optik decided to evolve its IT landscape into a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

“This goal” refers back to the phrase in italics in the first sentence and reminds the reader of what the focus of the main problem that was successfully resolved by the customer-protagonist of the story.

The Customer Reference Story document has a good number of referential cohesive devices that create strong ties within the sentences in the text by mostly relying on backward-pointing.

**Causal cohesion** according to Louwerse (2005) is may be the most important type of cohesion as it follows our logical processes of establishing cause/result relationships. Conjunctions are the grammar components that tie sentences together based on causality. Here is an example from the document in which the two clause are in causal relationship connected by the conjunction “because of”:

The results of the first project _impressed_ all involved, including management, _because of_ tangible savings from fewer lens rejections...

The document employs vocabulary-based devices to express causality between sentences, which Louwerse (2005) identifies as the more implicit way to create a causal type of cohesion. The word “impress” in the previous example is one such lexical device as well as the connecting phrase in the following sentence pair:

...instead of one call retrieving all the data on a customer, many relevant functions in different systems have to be called upon. _This is one reason why_ Apollo-Optik began to focus on transitioning to a more efficient SOA and implementing re-usable services across all systems.

In yet another example (in the “Looking to improve order quality” section on page 2 of the document), the reason behind the introductory sentences is presented by developing a whole mini-narrative withing the main “story”, introduced by “Here is why:...”. That mini-narrative, in turn, is tightly built around “If... then” causal sentences. Overall, the tendency in this document is to employ subtle forms of causal cohesion, instead of the more obvious causal conjunctions.

**Temporal cohesion** in the Customer Reference story creates interesting temporal relationships within the text. The text uses two grammar tenses for most of its part:

*   Past simple – to tell of the events around the initial problem facing the customer and the steps that the customer (assisted by our Professional Services department) took to reach the solution.

*   Present simple – to talk about the future potential for other joint projects.

In this way the grammar-based temporal cohesive devices create a linear temporal plane “before” and “after” a critical event (the implementation of the solution) took place. The vocabulary-based cohesive devices function differently in the text. They create two temporal planes, two time-lines that run through the text side by side. On the one hand, we have adverbial phrases that point to real-time events, for example: since 1993, each year, every day, in the future, peak times. On the other hand, we have time adverbials that create a parallel time-line of immediacy and efficiency, for example: on time, every time, in timely way, in under two seconds.

This duality in time is mirrored by a corresponding duality in space, which supports Louwerse&#039;s (2005) observation that temporal cohesion and **spacial cohesion** often function in similar ways. One group of space cohesive elements in the text are vocabulary about places, for example: Germany, Austrian, Europe, store location, or grammar entities, for example, prepositions of place: _at_headquarters _in_ Schwabach. They create the real space of real places in the document. However, another group of space cohesive devices (grammar and vocabulary-based), creates a virtual space in the document, where the products and solutions exist, for example: runs _on_ local Linux servers, The service is _hosted_ and controlled _by_ the webMethods Integration Server.

The duality created by the temporal and spacial cohesive devices in the text contributes to the text&#039;s interconnectedness by creating not one, but two connecting thread of time and space.

Additive cohesion occurs in several places in the document to allow adding new information to old information, for example:

_Alongside_ the central Microsoft Dynamics NAV (formerly Navision) standard ERP system with relational data storage, the company has two other customized IT solutions at headquarters in Schwabach, Germany.

The elements in the document that create additive cohesion are exclusively grammatical (adverbs and conjunctions), for example: alongside, as well as, also, furthermore. The use of additive conjunctions in this text is moderate and as a result the distinction between new bits of information in the text and things that have been mentioned before is not made explicit.

Coherence in the Customer Reference Story

The document is an attempt to tell “a story” with a main character (the customer) and a plot (how the main character resolved a challenge). On the surface, the Customer Reference story is a well-structured document. It provides a consistent layout, with sections and meaningful titles that lead the reader through the text. The first page is a summary of the story and the other pages develop the “story line” in greater details. Important points are high-lighted in bullet lists and the reader is given a lot of examples (one as we saw in section “Looking to improve order quality“ is a mini-story of lenses gone terribly wrong) and quotes from a spokesperson for the customer. The structure of the document promises a very coherent story as it moves from the general to the specific (from the challenge facing the customer through the general solution provided by the company to more specific examples of how that benefits the customer).

However, a close reading of the document leaves the reader with a feeling of disjointed and fragmented comprehension. The thematic links between paragraphs are not very obvious, for example in the following two paragraphs:

The service coordinates tens of thousands of requests from POS systems every day from the hundreds of store locations. Each request is answered in less than two seconds—helping to ensure customer satisfaction in a timely way.

The SOA platform “makes the solution very scalable,” Ehbauer said. “This is especially important because our stores don’t have a steady flow of customers throughout the day but they have to deal with busy peak times.”

The text returns from a more specific discussion of the order-quality service (the new information in this section) to the whole of the SOA platform (an older theme at this junction in the text). The transition is somewhat edgy as we lack any “clue words” (Beaken 2007) that would normally serve as thematic links. As we saw earlier, the temporal and spacial cohesive elements in the text establish two time and space dimensions – that of real events happening in the world of the customer and that of virtual events existing in the world of the solution. The moderate use of causal and additive connecting words between paragraphs, shifts the time, space and occasionally even the causal relation of ideas from the sentence level to the section level. In this way, the section titles become indispensable to the coherent reading of the text.

Another structural challenge that the document presents to the easy comprehension of the text is the paragraph structure. Paragraphs are unnecessarily fragmented, they do not break to introduce a new idea, but rather to provide visual symmetry. The following two paragraphs, for example, would read much better as a single paragraph:

This highly competitive environment is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses. That’s why Apollo-Optik, as Germany’s largest retail chain, operates by the motto “far more than glasses.”

In other words, it aims to provide the highest level of quality in customized eyeglasses on time, every time. To accomplish this, Apollo-Optik relies on several different back-end systems and corresponding business processes.

The Customer Reference Story document provides a sharper focus when it comes to lexical coherence. It offers two sets of words that link the text to the world outside the text. One group of words are related to the business world of the customer, for example:

optic – focus – lenses – eyeglasses – opticians – retail – revenue – customer satisfaction – store image

The other vocabulary set comes from the technology realm of the solution provided by the company:

Service-Oriented Architecture – back-ends – point-of-sales systems – platform – business process management

The document does not go into definitions or explanations of the technical lexical items that it employs, which indicates that it assumes high-knowledge readers. Interestingly, this assumption could explain why the text has lower levels of cohesion in some areas, as Louwerse (2005) argues that readers with high-knowledge deal well with low-cohesive texts.

The moral of the story

The analysis of the Customer Reference Story has shown that cohesion influences the coherence of a text. The lower levels of temporal and spacial cohesion in the document have made necessary the inclusion of other structural elements in the text, such as section headings to serve as thematic links. Another way that the text achieves coherence is by using relevant lexical items that the a reader with high-knowledge of the subject could easily map to his real world experiences.

Although, cohesion and coherence are helpful components in studying the “textuality” of a document, if we truly want to arrive at a full understanding about how we comprehend the meaning of a text, we will need to consider other factors as well. Text exists within the paradigm of co-text (Beaken 2007). In the case of the document under discussion, the surrounding text is the company web site where this “story” is one of many customer success stories. Text is also situated in an external context (de Beugrande and Dressler 1981). The context of the Customer Reference Story is defined by the author(s) and their intended goals with the document (or the intentionality of the writer, to use Beugrande&#039;s term). Louwerse (2005) even argues that we could talk about coherence of intentionality, that is how well the writer sustains her intended goals with the document and her mental image of what the audience knows about the subject will influence the coherence of the text.

However, if we accept the view of text as communication event in which meaning is established in the interaction between reader and text, the background knowledge of the comprehender is equally important to the intentions of the writer. “... coherence can be perceived and communication is more likely to be successful if the receiver&#039;s background knowledge is sufficient for making an interpretation.” (Transkanen 2006)
